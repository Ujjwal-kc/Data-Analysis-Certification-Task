In this project, I will be performing comprehensive data analysis after cleaning the raw coffee sales data. I am using python 3.12 in this project.

I am using mamba environment manager for this project. If you are using mamba you can use the following command
    `mamba env create -f environment.yml`

For those who don't use mamba you can use the following command
    `pip install requirment.txt`

And the following are the python library i will be using for this project 

    numpy
        for handling numeric claculations and multidimentional array  

    pandas
        for reading, cleaning, merging, transforming, summarizing data 

    matplotlib and seaborn
        for visualizing data in charts, plotting and exploring relationship and patterns 

    openpyxl
        for reading, handling excel files
